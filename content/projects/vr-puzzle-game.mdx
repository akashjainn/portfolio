## Overview

VR Bomb Defusal Puzzle is an immersive virtual reality game built for the **Meta Quest 3** using **Unity 6000.0.35f1**. Players must carefully cut color-coded vines in the correct sequence to defuse a bomb before time runs out. One wrong cut and it's game over!

## Gameplay

The core gameplay loop is intense and satisfying:
- **Observe** the bomb and identify the vine cutting pattern
- **Grab** your blade tool using VR hand tracking
- **Cut** vines in the correct color sequence (e.g., Red → Blue → Green → Green → Red)
- **Avoid** wrong cuts - three strikes and the bomb explodes!
- **Race** against time to complete the sequence before the timer expires

## Technical Implementation

### Core Systems

**Vine Cutting Mechanics**
- Physics-based blade interaction using trigger colliders
- Velocity-gated cutting (minimum speed required)
- State management with idempotent `Cut()` operations
- UnityEvent system for modular feedback

**Bomb Controller**
- ScriptableObject-based pattern system for data-driven sequences
- Real-time validation of player actions
- Strike counter and timer systems
- Event-driven architecture for extensible gameplay

**VR Integration**
- Meta XR SDK and OpenXR for Quest 3 support
- XR Interaction Toolkit for natural hand interactions
- Input System for action-based controls
- Hand tracking and controller support

### Key Components

```csharp
// Vine.cs - Individual vine behavior
public class Vine : MonoBehaviour {
    public VineColor color;
    public UnityEvent onCut;
    
    public void Cut() {
        if (isCut) return;
        isCut = true;
        onCut?.Invoke();
    }
}

// BombController.cs - Game orchestration
public class BombController : MonoBehaviour {
    [SerializeField] private BombPattern patternAsset;
    [SerializeField] private int maxStrikes = 3;
    [SerializeField] private float timeLimit = 60f;
    
    private void HandleVineCut(Vine vine) {
        if (vine.color == targetOrder[currentIndex]) {
            // Correct cut!
            onCorrectCut?.Invoke();
        } else {
            // Wrong cut - add strike
            strikes++;
            onWrongCut?.Invoke();
        }
    }
}
```

## 3D Assets

I created custom 3D models for the game environment, including stylized vines and trees that fit the bomb defusal theme. The models were designed with VR performance in mind - optimized poly counts while maintaining visual fidelity.

<div className="my-8">
  <ModelViewer 
    modelPath="/models/vine-trees.fbx"
    autoRotate={true}
    showControls={true}
    className="w-full h-[600px]"
  />
</div>

## Gameplay Demo

Watch the bomb defusal mechanics in action:

<div className="my-8 rounded-xl overflow-hidden border border-gray-800 relative" style={{ paddingBottom: '56.25%' }}>

    allowFullScreen
  />
</div>

## Architecture & Patterns

### Event-Driven Design
All vine cuts trigger UnityEvents, allowing modular attachment of:
- Audio feedback (SFX)
- Haptic feedback
- Visual effects (particles, color changes)
- Score/progress updates

### Data-Driven Configuration
Bomb patterns are ScriptableObjects, making it easy to:
- Create new puzzle sequences without code
- Test different difficulty levels
- Share patterns across levels

### Clean State Management
```csharp
void StartRound() {
    ResetRound();
    _active = true;
    // Subscribe to vine events in OnEnable
}

void OnDisable() {
    // Always cleanup listeners to prevent memory leaks
    foreach (var vine in vines) {
        vine.onCut.RemoveListener(HandleVineCut);
    }
}
```

## Tech Stack

- **Engine**: Unity 6000.0.35f1
- **Platform**: Meta Quest 3 (Android/OpenXR)
- **VR Framework**: XR Interaction Toolkit 3.2.1
- **Input**: Unity Input System 1.13.1
- **Rendering**: Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
- **SDK**: Meta XR All-in-One SDK

## Key Features

**Physics-based cutting** with velocity validation
